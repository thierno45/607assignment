#                    introduction 
# This data set helps predict the winner of the 2022 world cup.
#. Link :  https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/world-cup-2022 

# first, we are going to load our library and then load the data set 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(tinytex)
wcup <- read_csv("wc_matches.csv")
```
# list of team1
```{r}
head(wcup$team1)
```
#list of team2 
```{r}
head(wcup$team2)
```
# team with highest score
```{r}
wcup$score1 > 3
```
# projected score 
```{r}
wcup$proj_score1

```
# graph score1 over team1
```{r}
ggplot(wcup= NULL, mapping = aes( wcup$team1, wcup$score1)) + geom_boxplot()
```
#                                   conclusion
# using some r function, we are able to understand the data set to predict the winner of the 2022 world cup
